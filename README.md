# ✈️ Airline Delay Causes - Data Visualization Project

This project analyzes and visualizes airline delay causes using data sourced from Kaggle. The data provides insights into various factors contributing to flight delays, including weather, airline operations, and more.

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:

[Airline Delay Causes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses?resource=download)

## 📋 Project Contents

The main components of this project are:

1. **📓 Notebook File:**
   - `Visualization.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualizations.

2. **📊 Visualizations:**
   - Graphs and plots illustrating trends and patterns in airline delays.

3. **🔍 Insights:**
   - Key findings from the data analysis, such as common causes of delays and their frequency.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
